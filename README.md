This repository contains code for the scraping, cleaning, and preparation for analysis of NYC schools hiring data in summer of 2022.

Anyone with access to the Open Market hiring system (and a Python IDE) could use these scripts to repeat the data-gathering process. Let me know if you give it a shot and/or if you run into trouble.
